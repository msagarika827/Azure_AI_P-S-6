# Azure AI Vision and Language Labs

## Project Description
This repository contains projects completed for Azure AI Labs, focusing on image classification with Azure AI Vision and text analytics with Azure AI Language services. The labs demonstrate the application of custom AI models for image and text data analysis using Microsoft Azure's powerful AI services.

## Prerequisites
- **Microsoft Azure Account**: Required to access Azure AI services.
- **Azure AI Resources**: Set up Azure AI Vision and Azure AI Language services.
- **Azure Portal Access**: To configure and manage resources.
- **Optional**: Visual Studio Code or any text editor for code editing.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/azure-ai-labs.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd azure-ai-labs
   ```
3. **Install Required Packages**:
   If using a Python environment, install the required Azure SDK packages:
   ```bash
   pip install azure-ai-vision azure-ai-language
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. **Set Up Azure Resources**:
   - Log in to your Azure portal and create resources for Azure AI Vision and Language services.
   - Note down the endpoint URLs and API keys for each service.

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - In the project folder, create a `.env` file to store your Azure API keys and endpoints securely:
     ```plaintext
     VISION_API_KEY=your_vision_api_key
     VISION_ENDPOINT=your_vision_endpoint
     LANGUAGE_API_KEY=your_language_api_key
     LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your_language_endpoint
     ```

3. **Running the Labs**:
   - **Image Classification**: Run the image classification script to test the Azure AI Vision model.
     ```bash
     python image_classification.py
     ```
   - **Text Analytics**: Use the text analytics script to analyze text data.
     ```bash
     python text_analytics.py
     ```
